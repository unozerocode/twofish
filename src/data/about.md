As Jesus demonstrated the providence of God by feeding 5000 people with five loaves and two fishes, we desire to share the Gospel with as many people as we can.  All revenue from this project will go toward supporting the Manantial school in Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, which provides affordable, quality Christina education to people of the community. Currently the school serves 220 students, with 300 on the waiting list. In order to provide an affordable option for local famiilies, the tuition is approximately $30 dollars per month, which covers 25% of our operating costs.
Your tour will not only enrich your trip by providing experiences not usually lived by tourists, but will also positively impact the opportunities and future possiblities of local children.
